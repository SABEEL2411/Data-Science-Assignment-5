# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

### Module 12: Case Study - COVID-19 Analysis

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to analyze and visualize global COVID-19 data to understand infection trends, death rates, and recovery patterns. The project involves data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and correlation between different variables such as confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and country-level happiness scores.

## Dataset
- **File Name:** covid_19_data.csv
- **Description:** Contains country-wise daily updates on confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases.
- **Source:** Provided in LMS under Module 12 resources.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading:** Import and inspect the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing values and inconsistent date formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Visualize global trends of confirmed, deaths, and recoveries.
   - Analyze country-wise and region-wise patterns.
   - Compare happiness index with infection rate.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Compute Pearson and Spearman correlations between happiness and confirmed cases.
5. **Visualization:** Create time-series, bar charts, and heatmaps.

##  Key Insights
- Identified trends in infection growth over time.
- Observed correlation between happiness and lower infection rates.
- Derived patterns that can help understand the social impact of COVID-19.
